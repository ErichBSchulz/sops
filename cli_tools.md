# Console Operations Guidelines

## Python Scripts

- use argparse
- console (print) verbosity of print statements is set by v, vv, vvv flag
- console display error suppression should only occur when a q flag is set
- maximise use of a shared terminal.py module for common functions
- use a color palate that should be configurable (roadmap)
- use `uv` and `pyproject.toml` for package management.
