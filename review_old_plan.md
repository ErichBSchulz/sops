When asked to review an old plan, refer to the making_plans.md

## Step 1

Edit the entire file as a block and give each task a number. (Count by 100.)

Make sure each task has the following block

    Clear: yes|no|tbd
    Flies required: TODO

List and ask permission to delete tasks marked as complete.


## Step 2

Give options to reorder to the task list if this is needed. If it is not, insert a footnote into file (or update the existing footnote) to say "order confirmed dd/mm/yyyy"

## Step 3

Examine the first task. If it clear then check you have all the files you need.

If you need files (read-only or for editing) you must stop and ask for them.
